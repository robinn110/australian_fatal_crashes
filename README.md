# Australian Fatal Crashes Analysis

## About this project
This project aims to analyse the trends in Australian road deaths. 

The dataset includes two tables of Crashes and Fatalities collected from January 1989 to October 2023.

## Insights
### 1.	Victim demographics

From 1989 to October 2023, there were over 50,000 road crashes and 55,000 victims. 

#### State
The most significant number of fatal crashes happened in New South Wales, with over 15,268 crashes and almost 17,000 victims, followed by Queensland and Victoria with 9,987 crashes (11,092 victims) and 10,977 crashes (12,097 victims), respectively.

#### Trends
The number of fatalities has been trending downward over the years. This decrease is assumed to be due to changes in traffic participants’ behaviours and improvements in road safety strategies in Australia.

#### Gender
Over 40,000 males were killed in road crashes, accounting for 72% of total fatalities. Almost three times more than female victims. The reason could be males are more likely to be involved in drunk driving, and women tend to drive slower than men. However, there is a need for more investigations into that. 

By month, March and December had slightly higher fatalities than other months in all genders.

#### Age group 
The fatalities that happened to the adult groups (from 17 to 64) accounted for the highest number, which was 41,346, accounting for 74.69% of total victims.  

Whereas the number of victims in the age group from 17 to 25 was 14,261, the highest among all age groups. 

### 2.	Factors analysis

#### Road User
Driver victims had the highest number of victims, 24,997 (45%), followed by Passengers with 12,674 victims (23%). That means the number of people who were killed in car crashes is the highest. That leads to the question of why crashes are more damaged with the involvement of cars when these vehicles are supposed to be safer for drivers and passengers. 

The groups of vulnerable road users (Pedestrians, Motorcycle Riders and Pedal Cyclists) had fewer victims but were still considerably high: 17,206 (31%). 

#### Crash Type 
Crash type refers to the number of vehicles involved in fatal crashes. 
There have been slight decreases in fatalities in both multiple and single-vehicle crashes. 

#### National Road Type 
According to this dataset, the fatalities on national or state highways, arterial roads, and local roads are remarkably higher than on other types of roads.

#### Time
Fatalities tended to rise after 2 pm and started to go down in the evening. Understandably, this time frame matches with after-work and after-school time, and people could participate in traffic more than other hours.

However, the number of fatalities at nighttime was still high compared to peak hours. Factors such as fatigue, shift work, extended working hours or sleep deprivation could be the main reasons.

#### Speed limit 
The number of victims who were killed on the roads with the speed limit from 60 to 110 km/h is higher than others. At the same time, the highest number of deaths happened on the streets, with the speed limit of 60km/h and 100km/h. 

## Recommendations 
The following recommendations aim to reduce road deaths and improve road safety:
#### 1.	Enhance Public Awareness Campaigns:
- 	Focus on high-risk groups, particularly males and individuals aged 17–25.
- 	Promote safe driving behaviours, emphasising the dangers of speeding, fatigue, and drunk driving.
#### 2.	Targeted Law Enforcement:
- Increase enforcement during high-risk hours, such as afternoons (after 2 PM) and nighttime, to deter risky behaviours like speeding and drunk driving.
- Implement stricter penalties for repeat offenders.
#### 3.	Infrastructure Improvements:
- Upgrade road safety features, especially on roads with speed limits of 60–100 km/h, with the highest fatalities.
- Invest in better lighting and signage, particularly on arterial and local roads with high fatalities.
#### 4.	Focused Interventions for Vulnerable Road Users:
- Design safer infrastructure for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, such as dedicated lanes and pedestrian crossings.
- Conduct educational campaigns targeting vulnerable road users and drivers to improve mutual awareness.
#### 5.	Time-Based Road Safety Programs:
- Align road safety campaigns with high-risk months like March and December to address seasonal spikes in fatalities.
-	Promote road safety during holidays when traffic volumes increase.
## Limitations
While this analysis provides valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged:
#### 1.	Data Completeness:
- 	The dataset only includes data up to October 2023, which limits the completeness of the 2023 analysis.
#### 2.	Attribution of Causes:
- This analysis does not include data on additional factors that may influence crashes, such as alcohol consumption, weather conditions, road quality, and traffic volume, which could provide deeper insights into the causes and circumstances of road fatalities due to a lack of granular data.
- Behavioural assumptions (e.g., male tendencies toward risky behaviours) are based on general patterns rather than causal evidence.
#### 3.	Lack of Socioeconomic Context:
- Socioeconomic factors (e.g., income, access to safe vehicles) are not included in the dataset, which could provide additional context for road safety disparities.
